1. Dialogs currently don't use resource loader, so if the loading fails, RIP. 

2. The scrollbar area currently doesn't work with horizontal scrolling.

3. Currently scrollbar area can't scroll with the mouse wheel! Why?
  It's because of the stupid way the input handling is implemented,
  ideally each element should be able to sink some sort of input event and if not,
  pass it up to the parent. But currently only the exact element you are hovering
  over can intercept the input events. What a bummer.

4. Add getPropertyLazy to lazily evaluate the default parameter, because
  sometimes initialization may be expensive and we don't want to execute it every time.

5. The text editor currently is very janky as it requires you to hover over it to enter anything,
  I should somehow facilitate "focused" elements in the editor.

6. Text box improvements:
  * Ctrl+Left/Right to stride by words.
  * Placing cursor with mouse pointer. 

8. Do something with rectangles that have inverted size. You can't select them currently although they are drawn.

9. Currently worlddata needs to accept a world as a parameter because it needs some data initialized prior,
  The tilemap needs its image, tile size set, etc.
  * Make a "world patch" to change some of the world's fields without altering everything else, then
    the worlddata can return that patch which user can apply.
  * Decouple world from it's rendering and everything else, instead make it a bare tilemap, removing all connections to
    tilesets and so on. Probably a better option.

10. Currently I'm doing `append(entities, []Character{})` in d_game to copy entities because umka copies only the pointer of the slice
  (it's an umka bug, can't do much about it for now). I reported the issue already and it should be fixed soon.
