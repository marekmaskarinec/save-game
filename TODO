2. The scrollbar area currently doesn't work with horizontal scrolling.

4. Add getPropertyLazy to lazily evaluate the default parameter, because
  sometimes initialization may be expensive and we don't want to execute it every time.

5. The text editor currently is very janky as it requires you to hover over it to enter anything,
  I should somehow facilitate "focused" elements in the editor. #7

6. Text box improvements: #7

9. Currently worlddata needs to accept a world as a parameter because it needs some data initialized prior,
  The tilemap needs its image, tile size set, etc.
  * Make a "world patch" to change some of the world's fields without altering everything else, then
    the worlddata can return that patch which user can apply.
  * Decouple world from it's rendering and everything else, instead make it a bare tilemap, removing all connections to
    tilesets and so on. Probably a better option.

11. Maybe savestates should be stackable instead.

12. You can load state when you fall into the pit. Wack.

13. Fix input system ordering going from first sibling to last, it should be from last to first.

14. Editor sessions.
  Editor sessions will allow you to restore window positions, sizes, selected options, et al. after you load the editor again.
  Lovely <3

15. Editor theming.
  I just removed d_colors.um and I intend to make a theme structure instead, could look sweet <3

16. Problem screen test.
