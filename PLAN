Entities & Dialogs
------------------

* F: Make scriptable dialogs, possibly introduce tokens into dialogue system to handle hypertext.
        "#{emote:happy}Hello! #{emote:}I'm some guy."
                Will first set emote to happy, after that write "Hello! ", set the emote to default, and write "I'm some guy."

* F: Make interactible, static entity that will show a dialog message.
