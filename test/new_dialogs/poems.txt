Nonsense is something we often find
City sounds or traffic hums
The quiet of the night
All these things can make us feel right

However, nothingness is something we can't ignore
An emptiness that makes us feel so poor
A black hole that we can't avoid
The feeling of being lost and alone
~
In nothingness, we find true defeat
A place where we can no longer cheat
The darkest part of our mind
That we can never hope to find
